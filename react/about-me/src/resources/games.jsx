The game has a continuous 2 second countdown and when it says \"go!\" each player moves in the direction they're holding. If two players land on the same spot they bounce back to their original space. This allows for some team members to stay back and block their opponents from hitting their hearts. This game was made for Wolverine Soft's 48 hour game competition and won 1st place out of 10 entries. The theme was \"3 lives, 2 buttons, 1 moment\".
