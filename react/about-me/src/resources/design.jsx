//       '"Boardgame" is a programming style game where you choose three moves hidden from your opponents and then reveal them in order. Players have the option to move one space, attack one space next to them, defend from attacks, and push a player one space away from them. The game is played on a six by six grid and placement of players and items is done using two dice to index into the board. Between rounds items will be randomly placed on the board, and then each dead player can place an item on the board.',
