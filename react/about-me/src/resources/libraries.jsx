      "Soundscape Generator lets you create fully customizable soundscapes from your audio clips. Have a rain forest that needs bird calls, rain, and far off roars? How about a city with cars, construction, and people? Using sounds you have you can immerse your player in any environment you can dream up. The soundscape generator creates multiple audio sources that each can randomly play from a list of audio clips,	repeat from that list of clips in an interval you specify, randomize audio clip pitch, randomize volume, and can be parented to different objects (in case you want your sounds attached to something). The script is easy to use and requires no coding at all!",

    description:
      'Transition Blocks is an asset for Unity3D that you can buy from the Unity Asset Store. It is an easy to use, and beautiful way to transition between scenes in your game. At its simplest all you need to do is drag a prefab into your first scene and call: Transitioner.Instance.TransitionToScene("SceneName"); Its power comes from the options you have to customize each transition. Transitions are made out of two basic parts: the transition block and the transition order. The transition block has an animation that tells it how to animate itself once it\'s placed and the transition order decides how to place the transition blocks over a time period you specify. ',
