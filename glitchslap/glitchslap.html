				Glitch Slap is a local multiplayer party game that will have both coop and vs. modes. It is a 2D platformer and the main mechanic is that players can charge up and release a slap in any direction. Hitting other players will send them flying, hitting objects can make them break, and some arenas will have objects that must be hit to accomplish a goal.</br>
			</p>
			<p class="gameText">
				Arenas are small levels that players compete in and can be anything from last player surviving wins, to destroy the most objects to win. In co-op the arenas could be boss battles or slapping each other to reach the peak of a volcano before it erupts. I want arenas to last between thirty seconds to less than a couple minutes to make them fun and hectic. All arenas will have some generated content to keep them interesting in each play through. The vs. and coop modes will both have an area to string multiple arenas together. This timed area will allow players to collect powerups to enhance their character before another arena starts. 
			</p>
			<p class="gameText">
				My hope is that this is a fun party game that friends can enjoy playing together.
