				About me
			</p>
			<p class="gameText">
				My name is Anthony Tesija. I'm a software engineer, game designer, and developer. I got started as a kid by drawing levels for my favorite games using paper and pencil. This quickly moved into making levels with games like Starcraft and Left 4 Dead. Luckily those games didn't just have map editors, they had a simplified way to write scripts with endless possibilities. AI, stories, and game modes were all at my fingertips with simple if / else blocks and trigger zones. My creativity and love of games pushed me into taking programming courses in college. After learning my first language, C++, in 2010 I jumped into game development and couldn't stop. Since then I've made and released a handful of games for free and I recently released my first paid game. I've had a lot of fun so far and don't plan on stopping!

These games are played by tearing the pieces off of my business card and flicking them around.

					The soundscape generator creates multiple audio sources that each can randomly play from a list of audio clips,	repeat from that list of clips in an interval you specify, randomize audio clip pitch, randomize volume, and can be parented to different objects (in case you want your sounds attached to something). The script is easy to use and requires no coding at all!

					Heart Hop is an eight player, team based, battle game played with four controllers. There are two teams, light and dark. Each team either needs to step on all their enemy's hearts or on the button at the back of their base. Players share a controller with their opponent with each player holding one side of it. The game has a continuous 2 second countdown and when it says "go!" each player moves in the direction they're holding. If two players land on the same spot they bounce back to their original space. This allows for some team members to stay back and block their opponents from hitting their hearts.

				</p>
				<p class="gameText">
					Its power comes from the options you have to customize each transition. Transitions are made out of two basic parts: the transition block and the transition order. The transition block has an animation that tells it how to animate itself once it's placed and the transition order decides how to place the transition blocks over a time period you specify.

The astronaut runs automatically and will turn when it bumps into a wall. The game is easy to learn and play, only requiring a touch to fire your jetpack. You have a small amount of fuel that will recharge when you are on the ground and deplete while using your jetpack. The challenge comes with maneuvering through hazardous traps while trying to conserve fuel. Each level has a key and collecting it will open the door to the next level. Beat all the levels to get to the escape pod and leave the moon!

					Holy Split! is a game about a robot astronaut with a color based plasma rifle. Colored alien blobs are attacking you and you must shoot them with their own color to kill them. You only have red, blue, and yellow to shoot with. Shooting blobs of the secondary colors green, orange, and purple with one of the primary colors that go into them will split them into two primary aliens. Hitting any alien with a color not used to make it will cause it to split in two. Each color alien has a different AI that will try to trick you. Oh and they multiply over time if you leave them alone so watch out!

					Lazer Eyez was made as a school project using the Microsoft Kinect to help children with Autism. Some autistic people have trouble maintaining eye contact and the game tracked head and eye movement as the main input to help alleviate that. In the game you are a super hero saving the world from alien invaders. You use your laser vision to shoot down their ships and stop them from destroying cities. While the game may not have helped like we initially wanted, it was a great experience to try to alleviate some effects of Autism.

					Blast Lords was my first ambitious project that played like a platformer version of Bomberman. It was four player local multiplayer with controller support. Each player had a set amount of lives and would spawn on a stage with each other. There were all sorts of items that could spawn randomly in the level. Items that changed the player's number of bombs, firepower, speed, health both positive and negative could all be found. The game featured a level editor and four tilesets to choose from when making them. There were a handful of levels included.

					Unfortunately this game was never completed. I started it during a summer in college and when classes came back it got harder and harder to get back into it. I use a lot of the assets and ideas from this game for starting points in other games so it was a great experience in the end!
