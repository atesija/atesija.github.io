					About me
				</p>
				<p class="gameText">
					My name is Anthony Tesija and I'm a game designer and developer. I got started as a kid by drawing levels for my favorite games using paper and pencil. This quickly moved into making levels with games like Starcraft and Time Splitters 2. Luckily those games didn't just have map editors, they had a simplified way to write scripts with endless possibilities. AI, stories, and game modes were all at my fingertips with simple if / else blocks and trigger zones. My creativity and love of games pushed me into taking programming courses in college. After learning my first language, C++, in 2010 I jumped into game development and couldn't stop. Since then I've made and released a handful of games for free and I recently released my first paid game. I've had a lot of fun so far and don't plan on stopping!

				<p class="gameText">
					Lost in Thought is about dreaming, loving, and losing. The idea I was trying to convey was when you dream and come up with something special that has meaning to you. After waking up you remember it fondly for a short time and then those memories fade away. Losing those memories is the permanent death of whatever feelings or ideas came from them. This is the first game I've made that was built around a story.

				<p class="gameText">
					Jettison is a puzzle platformer that features a thirty level story mode and an impossibly difficult set of challenge levels designed to test your skills. You play as an astronaut escaping an exploding factory on the moon. The factory you're escaping has deadly traps including acid and timed lasers. The astronaut runs automatically and will turn when it bumps into a wall. The game is easy to learn and play, only requiring a touch to fire your jetpack. You have a small amount of fuel that will recharge when you are on the ground and deplete while using your jetpack. The challenge comes with maneuvering through hazardous traps while trying to conserve fuel. Each level has a key and collecting it will open the door to the next level. Beat all the levels to get to the escape pod and leave the moon!

Shooting blobs of the secondary colors green, orange, and purple with one of the primary colors that go into them will split them into two primary aliens. Hitting any alien with a color not used to make it will cause it to split in two. Each color alien has a different AI that will try to trick you.

					Blast Lords was my first ambitious project that played like a platformer version of Bomberman. It was four player local multiplayer with controller support. Each player had a set amount of lives and would spawn on a stage with each other. There were all sorts of items that could spawn randomly in the level. Items that changed the player's number of bombs, firepower, speed, health both positive and negative could all be found. The game featured a level editor and four tilesets to choose from when making them. There were a handful of levels included.

					Unfortunately this game was never completed. I started it during a summer in college and when classes came back it got harder and harder to get back into it. I use a lot of the assets and ideas from this game for starting points in other games so it was a great experience in the end!
